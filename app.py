# TV Delivery Schedule Optimizer

This Streamlit web app uses Linear Programming to optimize the delivery schedule of TVs from depots to stores, minimizing the total transportation cost.

## Features

- Upload or use default depot-store distance matrix
- Define depot supply and store demand
- Optimized shipment plan using `pulp` LP solver
- Total transportation cost calculation

## How to Run
